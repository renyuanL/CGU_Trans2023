00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
嗨,大家好,歡迎收聽《長庚你說》,我是代辦小編 Jojo。

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,840
那這一集呢,我們主要是要錄長庚的語文中心,

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
要帶你了解我們長庚大學語文中心到底在做什麼,

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
還有什麼樣的資源呢,可以供大家利用。

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,280
Hello, teacher Greg, nice to see you.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,120
Hey, great to be here.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,280
Ok, first, we are honored to invite this special guest to participate in the project.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
And we also appreciate that you are willing to share your teaching experience

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,720
and the information about CGU Language Center with the audience.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,560
So, can you please give us a brief introduction of yourself?

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,600
Yeah, sure, I come from Buffalo, New York, in Chinese that's Shui Niu Cun.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,880
I went to university in New York City at Brooklyn College.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
I got my master's degree at University of Alaska.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
You know, that's a cold place, Alaska.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,720
Yeah, pretty.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,000
And then I came to Taiwan, and I got my PhD in eco-criticism.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
That's like a kind of, in a nutshell, that means like looking for green

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040
or environmental readings in literary texts.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,760
And I extended that to anthropology for my research,

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,160
which I did in Northeastern Cambodia.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,200
And I've been working at Chang'an University since 2007, from 2007 to 2017.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,560
I took a short break where I brought my family back to the United States.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,080
And then I was very happy to come back to Chang'an in 2020.

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,200
And I've been here since and hopefully until Tiangong calls me.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Ok, then it's time for our Q&A.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
Here's our first question.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,480
What kind of teaching resources does Chang'an Language Center provide for students?

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
We have several.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,480
On every Tuesday and Thursday night, we have English Conversation Club.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,920
On Tuesdays, that's done by Teacher Timothy.

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,760
And on Thursdays, I do that.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,240
I think we use a similar approach.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Basically, it's held for 12 weeks throughout the semester.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
I think weeks 4 through 16.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
And we come up with a certain topic every week.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
And then we make a list of discussion questions.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
And we have a line group for that.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
And so we post the questions in advance,

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
so students can read through them and see if this topic interests them.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
And then if they are interested,

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
they can familiarize themselves with the questions.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
And then once the group actually meets,

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
we have a little introduction.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,000
And then we pair people off into groups of two or three.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,520
And then Timothy and I will filter around to each group

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,760
for about five, six minutes a piece

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
to listen to students' pronunciation.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
Try to correct their pronunciation,

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
add vocabulary where needed,

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
and just kind of join in on the fun.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,480
It's a very relaxed and kind of informal,

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,240
yet structured way to get extra English practice.

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,160
And that's every Tuesday and Thursday nights

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,280
from 6 p.m. until 7.30 p.m.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,400
And then on Tuesday and Thursdays

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,320
from 1 o'clock until 3 o'clock,

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,480
we have the English Writing Center.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
And on Tuesdays,Teacher David does that,

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
and on Thursday, it's me.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
And the way that goes is,

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
and this is open to Chang'an students,

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,600
research assistants, Chang'an teachers, faculty,

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,320
anyone at Chang'an University can come and use this service.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,320
And what you do is you bring us

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,680
an English document you have,

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
whether it's a statement of purpose,

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
an essay from one of your classes,

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
or any kind of English document,

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
and we will read through it with you.

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
Like the process kind of goes like this.

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,240
We try not to make it like a repair shop type of thing,

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,960
where you bring us like a mangled document,

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
and we just go through with a red pen

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
and correct all the grammar,

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,320
although we will do that.

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,200
But we will read you what you have given us.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
When you hear someone else,

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,960
when you hear the words that you wrote

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
coming out of someone else's mouth,

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
it's kind of easier to hear the mistakes.

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
And then we try to self,

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,880
we try to co-correct the errors

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,000
in the sentence together,

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,520
and we look for patterns

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
and all the details,

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
in terms of grammar,

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
and we fix it together,

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
rather than just like,

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,760
here's a kind of a messed up essay.

90
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Can you please fix this for me?

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,840
So we make this more of a learning process,

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,000
where we co-edit and co-fix it together.

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
And even if you don't have any English classes,

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,480
and you don't have any English documents,

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,680
but you're interested in improving your writing,

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
just come down,

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,960
and we will create an assignment for you.

98
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
We'll talk about your situation,

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
whether you're trying to prepare for TOEIC or GPT,

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
or you just want to get better at writing.

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
We can make an assignment for you

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,800
and start the process.

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
So no matter what, there's this.

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
And I think the Writing Center

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
is particularly important

106
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
because writing in English

107
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,840
is just so much different

108
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
than it is in Chinese.

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,600
There's no relationship

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
grammatically, linguistically,

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
or anything between Chinese and English.

112
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
So it's a big jump

113
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
to go from Chinese to English.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
It's very hard to do it well.

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,240
Although I have to say,

116
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
I've been impressed

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
with Changgeng's students' ability to write.

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Overall, they're pretty good, yeah.

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
And let me ask you a question.

120
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
When you talk with students like me,

121
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
you think that grammar is important

122
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,200
or our pronunciation,

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,360
or you think that if you can,

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,080
you have the courage

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
to talk to a foreigner, it's better.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,640
The courage to talk is better.

127
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Most people aren't going to notice,

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
especially in spoken English,

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,480
most people won't know

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
really notice small grammar errors.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
And those can actually,

132
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
when you're talking to people,

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,080
to non-native speakers,

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
those can be kind of seen

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
as local varieties of English,

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,120
which are natural.

137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
And even if you were in the United States,

138
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
people from Texas talk much different

139
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,680
from people in New York.

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,200
There's huge differences,

141
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
let alone someone from London,

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,000
and someone from London,

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
and someone from Scotland.

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
So there's always differences.

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
There's always accents.

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
The courage is more important.

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
The grammar, I guess,

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
would be something

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
you'd be more concerned about

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,560
in an email.

151
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
But as far as speaking goes,

152
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
have the courage to speak,

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
including in class.

154
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
Classes tend to go silent

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,640
when a teacher asks a question.

156
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,960
And unless we go through the roll call

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
and choose a name,

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
there's about zero chance

159
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,640
of a student offering up an answer.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
So the courage is needed.

161
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,520
Yeah, pretty.

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,280
OK.

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
And our next question is,

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
how do you teach your students?

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
And what method do you recommend

166
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,040
for people who want to learn English?

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Well, for me personally,

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,040
I like to use environmental awareness

169
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,560
as the main focus of our lessons,

170
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
at least for the first half of the semester.

171
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
And it's not just talking about

172
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
like koala bears or snow leopards

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,040
or tigers or elephants.

174
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,800
It's the threats that go with them,

175
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
their habitat destruction,

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,920
whether it's mountains,

177
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
forests,

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,600
oceans,

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,240
glaciers.

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
And a glacier is like a being hood,

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,880
right?

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
There's all kinds of problems

183
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,760
or illegal hunting.

184
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
All the problems

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
are always much bigger than that.

186
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Why do these problems exist?

187
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,680
There's a demand for it.

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
People want status symbols.

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
People sell it for money.

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
There's no law enforcement.

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,200
The police aren't doing their job.

192
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,440
The government doesn't prioritize this.

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
There's an international syndicate

194
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
where people are shooting

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
certain birds in Indonesia

196
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,760
and secretly shipping them to China

197
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,080
or tigers being shot in India

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
secretly shipping them to China.

199
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
Why do these people want them?

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
Traditional Chinese medicine values,

201
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,760
status symbols,

202
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
so many elements you end up.

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
So it's never just about animals or wildlife.

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
It always encompasses

205
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
a very wide range of issues.

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
So when we're learning

207
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,920
about all these different topics

208
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
and just using wildlife

209
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
as a basic structure

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
to get into all kinds of stuff.

211
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,840
And I found that students

212
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
are generally very interested

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
and receptive to this.

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,480
And then in the second class

215
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,120
half of the,

216
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
after the midterm exam

217
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
we'll get into,

218
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
we kind of shift gears

219
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
and we go into

220
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
like modern issues,

221
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,800
well,that's a modern,

222
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
wildlife trade is certainly a modern issue,

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,160
but like space travel

224
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,080
and the idea of humans

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,920
colonizing other planets.

226
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,120
And that might seem unrelated,

227
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,800
but it's actually totally related

228
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,920
because,you know,

229
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
maybe we're destroying the earth so fast

230
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,520
that we may have to go

231
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,000
and find a new planet to colonize

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
because we're ruining this one.

233
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,480
So I actually start to see

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
the connections between space programs,

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,520
space exploration

236
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,040
and the snow leopards

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
and the elephants.

238
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
So it's all connected.

239
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
And I think the students can see that.

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
And in the tests and quizzes,

241
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
there's always a couple of essay questions

242
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,920
where I ask them to explain that.

243
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,280
And I can really see

244
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,280
that they have absorbed this,

245
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,320
digested this,

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
understood this,

247
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
synthesized this

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
and then articulate this in these essays.

249
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,480
And I have to say,

250
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm usually very proud of

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
what the students do on these tests.

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,280
And I think it's because

253
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,640
I've chosen a topic which interests them.

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Yeah.

255
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,520
So you always use the

256
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
environmental protection

257
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
or some of the outer space

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
to be your teaching resources.

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,920
That's right.

260
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Yeah.

261
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,120
Yeah.

262
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
And as far as resources go,

263
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,520
I, like most teachers, use a textbook.

264
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,840
I use National Geographic's

265
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
Reading Explorer 3.

266
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
And these topics are all in these chapters.

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
But I also use a website

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
called Canvas, canvas.instructure.

269
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
And then I make my own weekly PowerPoints

270
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,320
to supplement all of the chapter materials.

271
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,600
And I gather the very current information,

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
whether in online articles

273
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
or YouTube videos

274
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,280
to add to what the textbook has.

275
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,600
So that students can learn quite a lot,I think.

276
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Yeah, that's pretty.

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
And let me share my way of learning English.

278
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm used to reading English books

279
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
like Diary of Wimping Kids

280
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
before going to bed.

281
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
And I also keep a diary

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
by making use of the words I have just learned

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
and to make sure that

284
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I firmly memorize those words.

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,520
And what do you think about keeping a diary?

286
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,760
Yeah, I think it would be really helpful

287
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,480
to kind of go through those words every day.

288
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,280
We all need to build on our vocabulary.

289
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,520
And keeping a diary maybe is a good idea.

290
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,200
Even for me, it might explain

291
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
why my Chinese isn't very good

292
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
because I learn words, but I forget them.

293
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
I don't write them down.

294
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,520
And I need to do that.

295
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,240
So expanding vocabulary for sure.

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Keeping a diary is a great idea.

297
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
OK, and our last question.

298
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,680
As we can see,

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
usually everyone is good at listening

300
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
and writing in English.

301
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Except for speaking.

302
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Then how can we improve

303
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
our English speaking ability?

304
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
You know, I think it well,

305
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
Taiwan is not an English environment.

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
And I think what you said is correct

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
about the listening and writing.

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,560
Because in fact,

309
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I just gave a listening quiz.

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
And I thought it's pretty challenging and complex.

311
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
And students, most of them

312
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
did a very good job on it.

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
They really can understand what I'm saying.

314
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
And they rewrote the story.

315
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
They reconstructed a short story that I said.

316
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
They did a very good job.

317
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
I think, you know,

318
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
well, first they can join our conversation club.

319
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,240
We also, another,

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
I forgot to mention another activity

321
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
the Language Center offers is movie night.

322
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
That's on Tuesday nights.

323
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,520
What I do is, that's from 6 to 8.30.

324
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I will introduce a movie,

325
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,760
tell you why it's culturally significant.

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,720
What to look for.

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,280
We play it.

328
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,000
Then we have a Q&A session afterwards.

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
That's another thing they can attend.

330
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
And there's another one.

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,360
We have starting on Tuesday, April 12th

332
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,280
in a CGUX room in the basement of,

333
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,760
you know, beneath the museum.

334
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,400
This is primarily aimed at juniors and seniors.

335
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,440
But it's open to everyone.

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
We want to help.

337
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
You know, we worry that maybe

338
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,960
because of the lack of speaking

339
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,560
opportunities in English

340
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
that maybe students might struggle

341
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,080
with job interviews in English.

342
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
So I'm going to have a new,

343
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
like a special kind of office hour

344
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
from 3 to 5 in that building.

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,160
I believe it's that building.

346
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,280
We'll have it on language websites very soon.

347
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
And this is for people who want,

348
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,280
who just need practice speaking English

349
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,600
but can't make it to the conversation club.

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,520
And they've already completed

351
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,440
all the required courses.

352
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,000
So like we can practice going through your resume.

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,600
I will play the role of being an interviewer.

354
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,960
And this is something that I think

355
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,480
can help get students ready

356
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
for their job interviews.

357
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,640
Or maybe like if they're applying

358
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,480
for a master's degree program

359
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
and have to meet online

360
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,280
with the coordinators of the,

361
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
you know, whatever school

362
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
they're applying to overseas.

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,280
So this is yet another one.

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
And then finally, I guess I could say,

365
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
you know, try to speak up in class

366
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,680
a little bit more.

367
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
You know, I've found,

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
as well as the teachers found,

369
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,840
sometimes our classes are large.

370
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,080
We have 60 students in our class.

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
And then it's kind of difficult

372
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
to get everyone to speak English

373
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,120
in a class like this.

374
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
But we try.

375
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
You know, we'll break students up

376
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
into groups of four.

377
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
And I'll try to filter around to,

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
they have a list of questions,

379
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,720
of structured questions.

380
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
I'll try to spend two or three minutes

381
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
with each group.

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
But I found repeatedly

383
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
that students will only speak English

384
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,560
if I'm in their group.

385
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,560
But I have to stand up and say,

386
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,760
look, the whole point of this

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
is that we're all talking in English

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
at the same time.

389
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Don't wait for me to come to your group

390
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
and don't speak Chinese,

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
Taiwanese or Hakka.

392
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,640
The whole point is

393
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,720
I should hear a lot of English being spoken.

394
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
But that doesn't really happen.

395
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,400
So I would just encourage them

396
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,880
to try to, you know,

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,280
really do the English activities

398
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
when they're in class.

399
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
Because I do understand their time,

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
their opportunities to speak English

401
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
are limited.

402
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
And this is what they've got.

403
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,800
And I guess one thing you can,

404
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
one more idea I have is

405
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
when everyone likes to watch movies

406
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,840
and stuff,

407
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm sure they use Chinese subtitles

408
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,360
when they're at home or on Netflix.

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
One thing you can do is

410
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
watch a movie the first time

411
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,160
using Chinese subtitles,

412
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
the second time using English subtitles

413
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
and the third time with no subtitles.

414
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
And so you started to learn it in Chinese,

415
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,120
then you went to English

416
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
and then see if you can train up

417
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
your ear without it.

418
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
Because if you were to go to movie theater

419
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
in the United States

420
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,400
or any English-speaking country,

421
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
there will be no subtitles.

422
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
It's not like Taiwan,

423
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
like where even when you turn on

424
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
the television news,

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
there's subtitles in Chinese.

426
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,840
I think that's a special culture here.

427
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,200
You got to get used to

428
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
not having the subtitles.

429
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
So, you know,

430
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
with, and I think music can help too.

431
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,880
You know, YouTube,

432
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,400
you know, or you're just,

433
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
you know, listening to music

434
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,120
on Spotify or whatever you have.

435
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
If you listen to English songs,

436
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,280
the popular culture can help too.

437
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah.

438
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Oh, there's really many ways

439
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
to help us to learn English well.

440
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,800
Sure.

441
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes.

442
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,800
And honestly,

443
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,240
until now,

444
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm still a little bit nervous

445
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,080
when having a conversation with you.

446
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,360
However,

447
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,080
it's really a valuable opportunity

448
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,000
to invite Teacher Gray

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,640
to introduce our language center

450
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,720
and share your teaching experience.

451
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you very much for your participation.

452
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,520
It's all my pleasure.

453
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:51,840
Thanks.

454
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,120
OK.

455
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,280
那今天我们的podcast节目

456
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,960
到这边告一个段落。

457
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
那Jojo在这边

458
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
想要提醒大家的是

459
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,600
其实我刚跟Teacher Gray的

460
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
conversation

461
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,680
都是用很simple的词句。

462
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,640
所以其实对话

463
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,400
没有你们想象中的这么难。

464
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
那我们也很欢迎大家

465
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
有空的话

466
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,680
可以点我们长庚的语文中心

467
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,320

468
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
